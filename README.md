# xorg-monospace-fonts-ttf

The X Window System has come with a pretty good assortment of bitmap
fonts since before Linux was even a pipedream.  The monospace fonts in
it happen to be pretty good fonts for coding.  Here they are, in
TrueType format.

This includes:

-   Lucida Typewriter
-   DEC Terminal
-   Misc Fixed (6x13, 10x20, and all the others)
-   Sony bitmap fonts
