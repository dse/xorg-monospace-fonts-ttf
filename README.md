# xorg-monospace-fonts-ttf

The X Window System comes with a pretty good assortment of bitmap
fonts.  The monospace fonts in it happen to be excellent for coding.

I distribute them here, in TrueType format, for your enjoyment and
use.

I do not take credit for the fonts, only for the scripts that convert
them to TrueType fonts that work well on your system.

This includes:

-   Lucida Typewriter
-   DEC Terminal
-   Misc Fixed (6x13, 10x20, and all the others)
-   Sony bitmap fonts

## Installation Instructions

Install the `.ttf` files like you would install any other TrueType
fonts in the operating system and/or font manager of your choice.

## Choosing A Font Size

**In Windows**, multiples of 3 will work best.  For `6x13`, for example, use a font size of 9.

**In macOS**, multiples of 4 will work best.  For `6x13`, for example, use a font size of 12.
